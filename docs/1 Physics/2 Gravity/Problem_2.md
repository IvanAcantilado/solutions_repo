# Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

Understanding **Escape Velocity** is fundamental to grasping what it takes to overcome a celestial body's gravitational pull. Building on this idea, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities represent the critical speeds needed to achieve orbit, break free from a planet's gravity, and ultimately exit an entire star system.

These concepts form the foundation of modern space exploration, enabling everything from satellite deployment to deep-space missions.

## Definitions

**1. First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity)**  
Minimum velocity required to orbit a planet near its surface in a circular path. It's the speed at which centripetal force equals gravitational force.  

*From Newton‚Äôs law of gravitation and centripetal force:*

$$
\frac{GMm}{R^2} = \frac{mv^2}{R} \Rightarrow v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

**2. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity)**  
Minimum speed required to break free from a celestial body's gravitational field without further propulsion.  

*Total mechanical energy at the surface must be zero for escape:*

$$
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{R} = 0 \Rightarrow v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
$$

**3. Third Cosmic Velocity (Interstellar Velocity)**  
Minimum velocity needed to escape the Sun‚Äôs gravity starting from a planet‚Äôs orbit (used for interstellar missions).  

*Assuming solar escape velocity from orbit:*

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{2} \cdot v_{\text{orbital around Sun}}
$$

*From Earth‚Äôs orbital radius and Sun‚Äôs mass:*

$$
v_3 \approx \sqrt{\frac{2GM_\odot}{R_{\text{orbit}}}
$$

*Or, estimated from Earth‚Äôs escape speed plus solar influence:*

$$
v_3 \approx \sqrt{2} \cdot v_1
$$

### Simulation Results

**Here are calculated values for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter:**

#### üåç Earth

- **1st Cosmic (~7900 m/s)** ‚Äì Velocity needed to maintain a circular orbit just above Earth's surface (Low Earth Orbit).  
- **2nd Cosmic (~11200 m/s)** ‚Äì The escape velocity ‚Äî needed to break free from Earth‚Äôs gravity without further propulsion.  
- **3rd Cosmic (~11180 m/s)** ‚Äì Velocity to leave the solar system, starting from Earth‚Äôs orbit ‚Äî accounting for Earth‚Äôs motion around the Sun.

#### üî¥ Mars

- **1st Cosmic (~3500 m/s)** ‚Äì Much lower orbital velocity due to Mars' smaller mass and gravity.  
- **2nd Cosmic (~5000 m/s)** ‚Äì Escape velocity is also lower than Earth‚Äôs.  
- **3rd Cosmic (~4950 m/s)** ‚Äì Slightly less than the escape velocity again, due to Mars already orbiting the Sun at high speed.

#### üü† Jupiter

- **1st Cosmic (~42200 m/s)** ‚Äì Very high orbital speed needed due to Jupiter's strong gravity.  
- **2nd Cosmic (~59500 m/s)** ‚Äì The energy needed to escape Jupiter‚Äôs gravity is massive.  
- **3rd Cosmic (~59600 m/s)** ‚Äì Almost the same as the 2nd cosmic velocity ‚Äî Jupiter is already moving fast in its solar orbit.
