By varying the angle of projection and measuring the resulting horizontal distance, we aim to identify patterns in the data and determine the angle that produces the maximum range. Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity, neglecting air resistance. The object follows a parabolic trajectory determined by its initial conditions: initial speed \ud835\udc63\ud835\udf03, angle of projection \ud835\udf03, and gravitational acceleration \ud835\udc54. Equations of Motion: We start with Newton's Second Law: $$ F = m \\\\a $$ For projectile motion, the only force acting is gravity.
